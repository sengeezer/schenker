# MSCE

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Setup

*Note:* Even though this project was bootstrapped with Yarn, npm can be used as well in its place.

Setup only consists of cloning the repo and then in the main directory running `yarn` or `npm install` respectively. (A recent version of Node being installed is assumed.)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

* **`yarn start`** : Runs the app in the development mode at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
* **`yarn test`** : Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
* **`yarn build`** : Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
* **`yarn eject`** : This command will remove the single build dependency from your project. It will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts.
